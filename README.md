# RISC-Emulator
This project is a Python-based tool designed to emulate the core functionalities of a Rediced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) processor. It provides a simplified and interactive way to udnerstand how a basic CPU operates by processing instructions in an assembly-like language.

It has the ability to process instructions in for key steps:
- fetching: retreives the next instruction
- decoding: breaks down an instruction into an operation and its arguments
- executing: carries out the specified operation
- udating: modifies the program counter to prep for the enxt instruction

This step by step approach mirros how real-world CPUs handle program execution. It has functions such as ADD, SUB, MUL, LOAD, JUMP, BRANCH_IF_ZERO, and BRANCH_IF_NOT_ZERO.
